# GDPS-Exploit-Fix
Fix exploit accounts and levels reuploads raid

What was the exploit and origin of raids? Well, account updates were uploaded without first verifying the encrypted passwords of accounts and levels were reuploaded without a timeout, if you still need releveling I have now added these timeouts to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

Update the files in their respective folders in your GDPS
